NumPy,
 which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. 
Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.

Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin.
 Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. 
 In 2005, Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. 
There are many contributors to this open-source project.


Using NumPy, a developer can perform the following operations −

    Mathematical and logical operations on arrays.
    Fourier transforms and routines for shape manipulation.
    Operations related to linear algebra. NumPy has in-built functions for linear algebra and random number generation.

NumPy – Data Types

bool_

Boolean (True or False) stored as a byte

int_

Default integer type (same as C long; normally either int64 or int32)

intc

Identical to C int (normally int32 or int64)

intp

An integer used for indexing (same as C ssize_t; normally either int32 or int64)

int8

Byte (-128 to 127)

int16

Integer (-32768 to 32767)

float_

Shorthand for float64

float64

Double precision float: sign bit, 11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa

float64

Double precision float: sign bit, 11 bits exponent, 52 bits mantissa

complex_

Shorthand for complex128

complex64

Complex number, represented by two 32-bit floats (real and imaginary components)

complex128
